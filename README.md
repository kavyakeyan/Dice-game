Dice Game ðŸŽ²

A simple multiplayer dice game built with Python where players take turns to roll dice and accumulate points. The goal is to be the first to reach a target score (default: 50 points), but beware! Rolling a 1 resets your turn's score.
ðŸŽ® How to Play

    Enter the number of players (2-4).
    Take turns rolling the dice:
        Roll a dice to accumulate points.
        If you roll a 1, your turn ends, and your turn's score resets to 0.
        You can choose to "hold" and add your turn score to your total, or keep rolling to risk getting a higher score.
    The first player to reach 50 points or more wins the game!
